# Sample Book

Chapter One
This is a short example chapter that demonstrates how the shared backend splits
content when the CLI runs in "auto" chapter mode. The content is intentionally
minimal so it runs instantly in tests.

Chapter Two
A second chapter provides enough material for the cache system to kick in when
`--resume` is used.
